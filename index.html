            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>At a young age, I realized two simple things: work hard and live with no regrets.</p>
            <p>I was raised in a humble household, where I started working under the tables and earning $5 per hour at the age of 12. This early start in the working world instilled in me a strong work ethic, propelling me through university on my own dime. Initially, I took the safe path, securing an accounting job in the public sector, lured by the stability of a pension plan. My life in my early-30s was secure but boring and unfulfilling.</p>
            <p>Everything changed when I lost my life-long mentor and father during the COVID crisis. It was a wake-up call, prompting me to re-evaluate my life. I came to understand that I had wrongly believed financial stability would lead to a life without regrets.</p>
            <p>The pain of losing my father pushed me to leave my secure job and explore the world while pursuing education online. During this journey, I uncovered my passion for data analytics, machine learning, and mathematics.</p>
            <p>Now employed at TaskUS as a Data Analyst, my longstanding expertise with Excel and Python has come in handy, enabling me to spearhead innovative projects such as automating business report processes and developing efficient backup data systems.</p>
            <p>These ventures not only showcase my technical skills but also my ability to innovate and streamline operations.</p>
            <p>I'm looking forward to bringing my knack for analysis and go-getter attitude to your team. I believe my path shows just how ambitious, resilient, and dedicated to growth I am.</p>
